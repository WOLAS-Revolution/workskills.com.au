			<p>Through the Department of Education and Training (DET) the state government aims to work with industry, registered training organisations (RTO’s), community organisations and communities to not only create more jobs but ensure skills are aligned to these jobs thus ensuring the skilling and upskilling of Queensland’s workforce.To achieve this, each year the department makes available funding to eligible organisations and individuals across the state.</p>
			<h3>Qld Government User Choice Funding</h3>
			<p>User Choice is a program through which employees may undertake an apprenticeship or traineeship qualification. Employers, apprentices or trainees can negotiate with a registered training organisation of their choice as to when and where they will attend college, the qualification they would like to undertake and any other aspect of the training to be delivered. Work Skills provide Traineeships and Apprenticeships through a Queensland Government DET funded user choice contract.</p>
			<h3>Certificate III Guarantee</h3>
			<p>The Certificate 3 Guarantee, which commenced on 1 July 2013, gives eligible individuals the opportunity to complete a full certificate III qualification. To do this, the Queensland Government will subsidise the cost of training for eligible students. The Certificate 3 Guarantee will direct government subsidies to training in areas that need more skilled workers. For those areas where skilled workers are needed, the Queensland Government will contribute more to the cost of training.</p>
