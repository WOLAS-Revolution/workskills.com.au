                                In our travels as a training provider delivering training throughout Queensland, we go into many businesses to see apprentices developing into chefs that can operate future kitchens with knowledge, skills, and confidence. We also come across some quite special workplaces and supervisors/employers. Craig Nothdurth is one of these people. Craig Nothdurth - Head Chef, Alexandra Headlands Surf Club. Craig is the head chef at the Alexandra Headlands Surf Club. He first completed his own apprenticeship in Toowoomba 15 years ago through Work Skills with one of our trainers, David Farmer.

                                Thank you customers for your feedback earlier this year. As an outcome we have improved our training model and introduced a Continuous Learning Cycle. This cycle ensures: Supervisor and Student and Trainer have increased communication There is an increased monitoring of assessment work and providing the student with every opportunity to complete and achieve success in the first step of their career. The student has a process to follow which results in a continual learning opportunity and through the Train the Trainer, they are able to build and demonstrate their skills.

                                Brendan Lewis - Work Skills trainer, Samuel Baldwin - Student, Zupps Qld. In support of the new Continuous Learning Cycle, Work Skills have introduced Training Wall Charts. These will be customised to every student and every workplace. The idea is to have the wall chart up in the workplace. It will show the student&rsquo;s progression, next appointment times, workplace practice tasks and communication notes. Now at a glance, students, supervisors, employers can see the student&rsquo;s progression.
