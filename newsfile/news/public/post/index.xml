      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our travels as a training provider delivering training throughout Queensland, we go into many businesses to see apprentices developing into chefs that can operate future kitchens with knowledge, skills, and confidence. We also come across some quite special workplaces and supervisors/employers. Craig Nothdurth is one of these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imgcap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://workskills.com.au/news/news/images/JK9A1175.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Craig Nothdurth&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Craig Nothdurth - Head Chef, Alexandra Headlands Surf Club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig is the head chef at the Alexandra Headlands Surf Club. He first completed his own apprenticeship in Toowoomba 15 years ago through Work Skills with one of our trainers, David Farmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Craig has supported around 66 apprentices through their qualification under his supervision. Craig has a strong work ethic and is the type of person who has high expectations, which he set for himself at a young age. He worked hard in his own apprenticeship, completing the 4 years work expectation/study in just 2 years. He has a fundamental belief that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s got something to teach someone else so don&amp;rsquo;t put yourself up on a pedestal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always keep learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to your values and morals, use these as your guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your previous experiences to learn from when facing challenges in the present and the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imgcap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://workskills.com.au/news/news/images/JK9A1182.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Surf Club&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Julie Waldren, Director of Work Skills, with Craig Nothdurth, Head Chef, Alexandra Headlands Surf Club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did Craig do his apprenticeship through Work Skills, but he has been using Work Skills to train his own apprentices. He enjoys the on-the-job training in the workplace. Craig sees real benefits from the fact that with Work Skills you don&amp;rsquo;t lose staff for &amp;ldquo;blocks&amp;rdquo; at a time. He also enjoys as a &amp;ldquo;hands on&amp;rdquo; chef watching the apprentices build their skills and guiding them as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig works hard to instil the old beliefs of quality and organisation, and understanding the importance of every job role in a kitchen and how they work together to get the best results. Craig also builds a strong relationship with the trainer, currently Mark Langley, and they work as a team to ensure the apprentices are given every chance to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imgcap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://workskills.com.au/news/news/images/JK9A1165.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Surf Club&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Alexandra Headlands Surf Club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONGRATULATIONS Craig on your success. The Alexandra Headlands Surf Club is growing. Due to the increased demand for quality function venues in the region, the Surf Club will be commencing an expansion in the second half of this year. They will be extending the kitchen and adding a &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo; kitchen. The venue will be offering a new tapas bar and a fully operational bistro. Planned completion is by Christmas 2015. This will undoubtedly be the place for weddings, 21st birthdays, and work functions; or head downstairs to the already popular, newly expanded Bluff Bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Work Skills Directors Philip and Julie Waldren, and Operations Manager Peter Groucott have been driving out west and up north of Queensland visiting some of our customers. It was great to talk to businesses and understand their challenges, their growth, their potential and their plan for building qualified staff using Work Skills powered through WOLAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank everyone for your time and hospitality. We appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Continuous Learning Cycle</title>
      <link>http://workskills.com.au/news/2015/08/continuous-learning-cycle/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2015 17:02:00 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://workskills.com.au/news/2015/08/continuous-learning-cycle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you customers for your feedback earlier this year. As an outcome we have improved our training model and introduced a Continuous Learning Cycle.
This cycle ensures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supervisor and Student and Trainer have increased communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an increased monitoring of assessment work and providing the student with every opportunity to complete and achieve success in the first step of their career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The student has a process to follow which results in a continual learning opportunity and through the Train the Trainer, they are able to build and demonstrate their skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;imgcap&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://workskills.com.au/news/news/images/CLC.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Continuous Learning Cycle&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Continuous Learning Cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 clear steps to the model which is completed with Trainer and Student working together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Training Wall Chart</title>

      <guid>http://workskills.com.au/news/2015/08/the-training-wall-chart/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;imgcap&#34; style=&#34;float:left; margin-right: 10px;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://workskills.com.au/news/news/images/tplan1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A customised training plan&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Brendan Lewis - Work Skills trainer, Samuel Baldwin - Student, Zupps Qld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In support of the new Continuous Learning Cycle, Work Skills have introduced Training Wall Charts. These will be customised to every student and every workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to have the wall chart up in the workplace. It will show the student&amp;rsquo;s progression, next appointment times, workplace practice tasks and communication notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at a glance, students, supervisors, employers can see the student&amp;rsquo;s progression.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A customised training plan.&lt;/p&gt;
