Thank you customers for your feedback earlier this year. We have been seeking input on what we can do better to service you, we have commenced an enhancement to delivering training services to you and your apprentice/trainee.

The Continuous Learning Cycle means the Supervisor and Student and Trainer have increased communication, increased monitoring of assessment work and providing the student with every opportunity to complete and achieve success in the first step of their career.

How does the Continuous Learning Cycle work in your workplace?

From the diagram you can see there are 4 steps to the cycle. Each step is about 2 weeks apart.

**Step 1.** The student is trained by their Trainer. The Trainer also gives the student a subject that they must research and prepare to train their Trainer on in 4 weeks time. 

**Step 2.** The Trainer logs onto WOLAS and checks the assessment work being completed on WOLAS. Trainer is on the phone and rings the student to discuss work and progression.

**Step 3.** The Student logs onto WOLAS in their workplace and over the phone trains their Trainer on the task they were to prepare. This can be a PowerPoint or photos or a video or bullet points or a simple discussion to demonstrate that the student knows the subject.

**Step 4.** The Trainer checks the progression of WOLAS assessment work, two weeks out from next training visit. The student is only connected if assessment work is not complete. The student’s supervisor is contacted if the assessment work is not on track.
