Thank you customers for your feedback earlier this year. As an outcome we have improved our training model and introduced a Continuous Learning Cycle.
This cycle ensures:

- Supervisor and Student and Trainer have increased communication
- There is an increased monitoring of assessment work and providing the student with every opportunity to complete and achieve success in the first step of their career.
- The student has a process to follow which results in a continual learning opportunity and through the Train the Trainer, they are able to build and demonstrate their skills.

There are 4 clear steps to the model which is completed with Trainer and Student working together.
