In our travels as a training provider delivering training throughout Queensland, we go into many businesses to see apprentices developing into chefs that can operate future kitchens with knowledge, skills, and confidence. We also come across some quite special workplaces and supervisors/employers. Craig Nothdurth is one of these people.

Craig is the head chef at the Alexandra Headlands Surf Club. He first completed his own apprenticeship in Toowoomba 15 years ago through Work Skills with one of our trainers, David Farmer.

Today Craig has supported around 66 apprentices through their qualification under his supervision. Craig has a strong work ethic and is the type of person who has high expectations, which he set for himself at a young age. He worked hard in his own apprenticeship, completing the 4 years work expectation/study in just 2 years. He has a fundamental belief that:

- Everyone's got something to teach someone else so don't put yourself up on a pedestal.
- Always keep learning.
- Stick to your values and morals, use these as your guide.
- Use your previous experiences to learn from when facing challenges in the present and the future.

Not only did Craig do his apprenticeship through Work Skills, but he has been using Work Skills to train his own apprentices. He enjoys the on-the-job training in the workplace. Craig sees real benefits from the fact that with Work Skills you don't lose staff for "blocks" at a time. He also enjoys as a "hands on" chef watching the apprentices build their skills and guiding them as required.

Craig works hard to instil the old beliefs of quality and organisation, and understanding the importance of every job role in a kitchen and how they work together to get the best results. Craig also builds a strong relationship with the trainer, currently Mark Langley, and they work as a team to ensure the apprentices are given every chance to succeed.

CONGRATULATIONS Craig on your success. The Alexandra Headlands Surf Club is growing. Due to the increased demand for quality function venues in the region, the Surf Club will be commencing an expansion in the second half of this year. They will be extending the kitchen and adding a "functions" kitchen. The venue will be offering a new tapas bar and a fully operational bistro. Planned completion is by Christmas 2015. This will undoubtedly be the place for weddings, 21st birthdays, and work functions; or head downstairs to the already popular, newly expanded Bluff Bar.
