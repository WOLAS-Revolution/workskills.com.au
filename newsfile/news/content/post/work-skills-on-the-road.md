The Work Skills Directors Philip and Julie Waldren and Operations Managers Peter Groucott have been driving out west and up north of Queensland visiting some of our customers. It was great to talk to businesses and understand their challenges, their growth, their potential and their plan for building qualified staff using Work Skills powered through WOLAS.
