In support of the new Continuous Learning Cycle, Work Skills have introduced Training Wall Charts. These will be customised to every student and every workplace.
 
The idea is to have the wall chart up in the workplace. It will show the student's progression, next appointment times, workplace practice tasks and communication notes.
 
Now at a glance, students, supervisors, employers can see the student's progression.
