Once again thanks to feedback from our customers, we will be putting the student’s training plan on the wall in the workplace so student and Supervisor can see the progression of learning.

This workplace will show progress and dates for next appointment and any other notes the Trainer writes up there.

<div class="imgcap">
    <div style="width:100%;">

Your Trainer will bring out your customised training plan to put on your wall.
