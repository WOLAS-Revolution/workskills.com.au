						<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
							<p>Work Skills delivers all its qualifications and units of competency through blended learning, comprising face to face, one on one training with a Work Skills Trainer. This may also include utilising CDs, DVDs, text books, learning guides, the internet, the phone and Work Skills Online Learning and Assessment System, WOLAS. The learning may comprise all or some of these methods. It will depend on location, pace that student wants to learn and employer requirements. This is all negotiated at the first check point meeting.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Option One: One on One Training</strong><br />
                                You can have the training as an individual. This allows you to have the training delivered at your own pace in a timeframe that suits you. We come to you and deliver training that fits into your work/life requirements. All assessments are completed at a pace that suits your needs.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Option Two: Classroom Training</strong><br />
                                All your learning an assessment for each of the units is delivered in a classroom environment with other students. For classroom training to occur we need a minimum of <strong>5</strong> students.<br />
                                We can deliver our training in a number of QLD locations. We have a portable classroom set-up whereby we have 10 computers and a Trainer available.<br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Option Three: Recognition of Prior Learning &#40;RPL&#41;</strong><br />
                                If you&#39;ve had lots of experience in this industry or similar in the past, you may be eligible for RPL.<br />
                                Recognition of Prior Learning means that you don&#39;t require the training but rather you just need to be assessed on each unit. You will need to draw on all your past experiences so that you can demonstrate that you have already acquired the knowledge and skills. You may be eligible for some units through the RPL process whilst other units may require some training.</p>

						<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
							<p>Every qualification has an <strong>expected level of language, literacy and numeracy</strong> requirement.<br />
                            Therefore at the commencement of a qualification we will ensure that the student&#39;s ability to comprehend LL&amp;N is recognised, and any issues that may impact on the opportunity to succeed in completing the qualification are identified. Work Skills offers support solutions i.e. additional training time, additional support from an industry or LL&amp;N specialist, different methods of assessment and more. Essentially we do all we can so that you achieve your qualification.</p>

						<dd class="accordionItem accordionItemCollapsed">
							<p>A flexible approach is offered by Work Skills to deliver the training and assessment. The nominal duration to complete this qualification is <strong>12</strong> months fulltime.<br />
                               If this qualification is completed part-time, or as a school-based student &#40;SAT&#41; then the nominal period of <strong>24</strong> months applies and in the case of SATs the maximum &quot;time completion framework per year&quot; applies.<br />
                               As this training is competency-based, students are able to complete the volume of learning at a pace that sees completion before the expiry of these time frames; however, the completion dates can vary from student to student, but will not exceed the nominal duration. </p>
